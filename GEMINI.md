When working on SvelteKit and Svelte projects, use Svelte 5 syntax with runes and always follow instructions in /svelte-llms.md file.
The documentation in /svelte-llms.md should be considered the source of truth for this project, overriding any of my internal knowledge about Svelte.

When asked to design, review or refactor a Svelte / SvelteKit web page or web component, use responsive mobile-first design principles and ensure that the design is accessible and user-friendly, beautiful and modern. For styles use Tailwind CSS version 4 unless project already uses different version.
