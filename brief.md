# Brief for designing a decision - making web app

The web app will help user make decisions from user submitted options. The user will be asked to type several options he/she cannot decide between. The app will then randomly select one of the options, but before doing that, it will display a short animation to build anticipation. The animation will be a spinning wheel with the options displayed on the wheel. The wheel will spin for a few seconds before stopping on the selected option. The app will then show an animation celebrating the selection, such as confetti or fireworks.
